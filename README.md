Code for the `jst-review` tool that does a lint check of Mozilla code in the style of Johnny
Stenback. I created a "web version" of this ages ago, and I can frankly not remember the history of
the tool.

The status of this is that I haven't looked at the code in almost a decade... just putting it on
github just in case there is anything of value.
